HTML
HyperTextMarkupLanguage(HTML) is used for designing static webpages.
Tags
Tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets.
Syntax:  <tagname>content goes here...</tagname>
Explaination: 
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.
HTML contains diffrent tags each having different functions. Some of them are defined below.
<html>This is the main tag
<head>Contains meta information about the document</head>
<title>Specifies a title for the document</title>
<body>Contains the content of the page</body>
HTML page structure:
<html>
<head>
<title>Page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration:
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
          <!DOCTYPE html>
where to write html code:
One can write html code on any editor,even it can be written on notepad, the name of file will having an extension of ".html".
now open the html document using any browser to see the webpage.
Let us see some useful tags in html:
HTML HEADINGS:
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>
HTML Image:
In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag.
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:
Syntax: 
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
Here the alt attribute provides an alternate text of an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it(basically it describes the image).
HTML TABLES:
Each table row is defined with the <tr> tag. A table header is defined with the <th> tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the <td> tag.
Syntax:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

HTML LIST:
There are two types of list:
Unordered list
Ordered list
Unordered list
An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
Syntax:
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
Ordered list
An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.
Syntax:
<ol type = 'i'>  // here i defines roman style listing.
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
HTML LINKS:
HTML links are hyperlinks. We can click on a link and jump to another document.
Hyperlinks are defined with <a> tag.
Syntax:
<a href="url">link text</a>
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.
example: 
<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
